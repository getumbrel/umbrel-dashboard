# ‚òÇÔ∏è dashboard

Dashboard is the web-based user interface of [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os) and is accessible at `http://umbrel.local`. It runs by-default as a containerized service.

## üöÄ Getting started

If you are looking to run Umbrel on your hardware, you do not need to run this service on it's own. Just download [Umbrel OS](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-os/releases) and you're good to go.

## üõ† Running dashboard

Make sure both [`umbrel-manager`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-manager) and [`umbrel-middleware`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-middleware) are running and available.

### Step 1. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn
```

### Step 2. Set environment variables
The following environment variables are set in `.env` file of the project's root:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `VUE_APP_MANAGER_API_URL` | URL of [`umbrel-manager`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-manager) API | `http://localhost:3006` |
| `VUE_APP_MIDDLEWARE_API_URL` | URL of [`umbrel-middleware`](https://github.com/getumbrel/umbrel-middleware) API | `http://localhost:3005` |

If you want to change the local development environment (e.g. to use you local umbrel instance), create the `.env.development` with the following content:

```sh
VUE_APP_MIDDLEWARE_API_URL=http://umbrel.local/api
VUE_APP_MANAGER_API_URL=http://umbrel.local/manager-api
```

### Step 3. Run dashboard
```sh
yarn serve
```

Dashboard should now be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Building dashboard
To build dashboard for production, run:
```sh
yarn build
```
Built code will be inside `/dist`.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Don't be too reckless

> Umbrel is still in an early stage and things are expected to break every now and then. We **DO NOT** recommend running it on the mainnet with real money just yet, unless you want to be really *#reckless*.
